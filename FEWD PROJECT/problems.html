                                    political participation. This can lead to unequal opportunities and limitations on
                                    their
                                    advancement.</p>

                                    spaces. This can have a significant impact on their mental and physical well-being,

                                    the
                                    same work. This perpetuates the gender pay gap and contributes to women's financial

                                    areas of society. This can limit their ability to make decisions that affect their

                                    discrimination. For example, women may be expected to prioritize domestic
                                    responsibilities over their careers, which can impact their advancement.</p>
